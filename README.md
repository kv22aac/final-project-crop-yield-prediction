The intention of this research is to solve the prediction challenges of increasing crop yields through effective pesticide usage.Through the best possible use of pesticides, the project seeks to solve the problem of crop production prediction through machine learning. The study suggests using modern technologies, such as machine learning, to handle complex data trends, considering traditional methods as outdated.Data on crop yields, rainfall, temperature, and pesticide use across different regions is taken from a Kaggle dataset. In order to predict agricultural yields, many machine learning models—such as Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Trees—have been employed in related studies. These models are examined in the literature review.

Data Handling and Preparation: The study demonstrates how to handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables one-hot.
Visualization and Analysis: To explain correlations between variables like rainfall, pesticide use, and crop production, exploratory data analysis (EDA) includes distribution plots and correlation heatmaps.

Modeling: Several models, such as XGBoost, Decision Trees, Support Vector Regression, and Linear Regression, are examined. Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared are used in assessing models.

These are the methodologies used in this project.

from this study we can see that machine learning models like Decision Trees and XGBoost are effective in predicting crop yields, and that geographical factors play a crucial role in agricultural productivity.
