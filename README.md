Through the best possible use of pesticides, the project seeks to solve the problem of crop production prediction through machine learning. The study suggests using modern technologies, such as machine learning, to handle complex data trends, considering traditional methods as outdated.Data on crop yields, rainfall, temperature, and pesticide use across different regions is taken from a Kaggle dataset. In order to predict agricultural yields, many machine learning models—such as Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Trees—have been employed in related studies. These models are examined in the literature review.
